<p><b>Button Masher</b> is a simple tool to help you analyze and
improve your execution of fighting game moves, combos, etc. It's
similar to the input display in the practice modes of various fighters.
If you keep messing up a move but you're not sure why, just load
this up and see exactly what you're inputting. Obviously, it's not
intended to be a complete replacement for a practice mode, but if being
able to reliably reproduce a movement is the problem, then this is for
you.
<p><b>Why use Button Masher when you already have a game with an input display?</b>

<p><ul>
<li>It runs on your PC, under Windows 9x/XP, and any other OS that supports your joystick and Pygame.
<li>It loads instantly and needs no configuration.
<li>It displays the number of frames elapsed at each input, so you
can see whether you're doing a move quickly enough, or check your JF
timing.
<li>No getting distracted by punching up the practice opponent.
<li>It's completely free.
</ul>
